You also can manage config online in the config module : <u>for general options</u>, choose language, debug, <u>for category option</u>, max level depth categories to display, display link in category treeview for upload, scenario or execution, <u>for case test</u>, steps per page, empty stemps by page, application of <b>ISTQB norm</b> as a <a href="#strategy">strategy</a> with case only in the fith level and ISTQB name at each level.</p><p class="uk"><a name="auto_installation">auto installation</a> | <a href=#>top</a><br />Generic option is written. All sql files by modules have the prefix PRE.The automatic installation is possible. In your navigator, go to install directory.Install directory detecte if you already have datables with this prefix or install sql files.If it is not the case you can proceed to the installation, then delete this install directory.</p><p class="uk"><a name="directory_project">directory project</a> | <a href=#>top</a><br />Files are not fat (less than 500 Ko for version 02.00.02). So, each project can have specific directory and can repeat all pages and have specific tables, specific config, specific ht access for acl.Example : project number 001 have directory name 001 and use all tables with prefix 001_.It is not more difficult than this (<a href="#auto_installation">same thing to proceed to installation</a>).</p><p class="uk"><a name="category">category</a> | <a href=#>top</a><br />Category tree displays hierarchical list of category with action.General links at the top of category list offer general action.<br />"Modify" change the number of level to display in the list.<br />A breadcrumb is used to navigate in the contextual hierarchical list (with limitation by subcategories and level). This breadcrumb use ISTQB labels if this option has been choosen in config file.<br />"Add" (in the top of the listing) add a category at the root of category.<br />"Remove" remove a category in an other category : parent, child or sister.Specific links, line by line offer action for the choosen category.<br />"Add" add a category child of the choosen category.<br />"Sub-categories" display only the subcategories of the category choosen and in the limit of the number level authorised.<br />"Update" update category name.<br />"Delete" delete category.<br />"Order" order category of same level, by the way of numeric. With decimal it is possible to reorder category without change anything.<br />Module links, line by line offer action of other module for the choosen category.<br />Several options authorize to display or not some information : type of upload documents by level (norm ISTQB)...</p><p class="uk"><a name="scenario">scenario</a> | <a href=#>top</a><br />Scenario is not made to be used directly. If it is the case a link invites user to to go to category module to select a scenario to display.Link "scenario" in category module use category name and offers user to create steps.Steps are displayed by pagination (paramaters are administrated in cinfig file)Steps can be administrated (create, upadte, order, delete) at the fly. No more time dispended to administrate scenario step by step.Head links are used for the integral scenario."All the scenario" goes to category module. A breadcrumb goes to the choosen category and display ISTQB category label if this option has been choosen in config file."Next scenario" goes to next category sister."Export scenario" exports scenario steps and category name with two levels of depth."Run scenario" goes to the  module "execution" for the scenario choosen.<br /><u>There are some links in category module.</u>"Scenario" allows user to create steps for the choosen category."Duplicate scenario" allows user tu duplicate category name and related steps in order to go work fast and similar as existant when a scenario has different variants.</p><p class="uk"><a name="execution">execution</a> | <a href=#>top</a><br />Scenario is not made to be used directly. If it is the case a link invites user to go to scenario module to select a scenario to display.If scenario yet exists and is not closed, scenario execution steps are displayed.Execution steps used scenario steps and add two fields : obtained and status.Execution steps list is displayed with pagination if steps excedded the number configured in config file.Steps can be administrated at the fly. No more time dispended to administrate scenario step by step.If execution  doesn't exist yet or is alreadey finished a form uses scenario name and authorizes  user to create at convenience execution name (as campaign, environment, date).An execution can be in paused or closed.<br />BECAREFUL, pause or close has no actions on steps results. It is just to pause or clause the iteration execution. You have to save data before by the submit button.<br /><u>There are some links in category module.</u>If an execution is paused, in category module, link exists :  "finish run test in progress".By category and scenario, only one execution in progress at the same time is authorized.If an execution is paused, in category module, link "[N] run test finished" goes to list of execution for the choosen category with export of results, and also viewing of results report (status, quantity of steps,percent).In category module, link "run scenario" goes to scenario module for the choosen category if scenario exists and is not in progress.<br /><u>There are some links in scenario module.</u>"Run scenario" goes to module execution for the choosen scenario.</p><p class="uk"><a name="upload">upload</a> | <a href=#>top</a><br />Document is normaly not used directly. If it is the case, a form invites to upload document and to rename this document.The upload module can be configured by config file : authorised file, max file size, directory file.Max file size is around to be inderstoob by user. This is better than a message like : 10000 Ko.List is admnistrated at the fly : rename or delete files.List has a link "see" which open an window to see the document.<br /><u>There are some links in category module.</u>"Upload media" goes to module upload for the choosen category.Type of category is registred, media name can be renamed."[N] attachment[s]" goes to list of category related attachment.</p></div></body></html>
